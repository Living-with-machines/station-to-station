      "(non-tt); the Exhibition opened on Saturday, 22 May 1886 and closed Saturday night, 30 October; its opening times included Sunday afternoons. To begin with, all visitors used existing stations: on opening day the dignitaries came by special train to Folkestone Junction [later F East] and many of the public came by other specials.  (T 24 May, 1 November) . On 31  May the General Manager of the SE wrote to the BoT saying that they wished to open for occasional passenger excursions a short branch to the Exhibition, up to then only used for goods; he asked for prompt action ‘as the Excursions will soon commence and we are anxious to run the trains right up to the Building’. On 8 June Major General Hutchinson reported that he had inspected it and saw no objection to opening provided stringent conditions were met. The line was one purpose-built for the Exhibition; about 1,500 yards long, starting from sidings on the south side of the line at Shorncliffe [thus in report, later Folkestone West] and running south-east to the site, immediately north of Bouverie Road; it had been built without an Act of Parliament since it was entirely on private land apart from crossing two public roads on the level. Hutchinson said the BoT could not sanction the use of the crossings but he implied that there was no objection to them provided they were careful. His suggested conditions included that trains should come to a complete stop before crossings, should not exceed 6 m.p.h., a platform should be provided at the Exhibition end and the line should be removed after the Exhibition’s closure. On the 9 th  the Board wrote giving its agreement, provided the conditions were met; it played safe by saying it had ‘no objection to’ (the usual ‘sanction’ was crossed out) the use and  including, ‘as it is only to be used for a short time I presume no objection will be made with regard to the level crossings’ – does this translate ‘alright unless the locals object’?  (MT6/408/8) . Art Exhibitions notice in  T, 9 June , says ‘Excursion trains from London daily, and from all parts of Kent, Surrey, and Sussex now running.’ Similar wording in all other papers sampled. Does not specify use of special station (mixture of special trains and excursion tickets by regular services? ‘occasional’ equals ‘daily?). SE co ½ referred to extra revenue but did not mention special station; no SE adverts seen. The only clear reference so far seen is in  Surrey Mirror , 11 September, which refers to the Redhill Harmonic Society’s special train drawing up at the doors of the Exhibition on the 7 th .\n",

E vidence seen would suggest that station was always at later site, in continuous use, renamed during gap in tt evidence (relevant tables in Brad were reorganised at both dates, with some detail missing in between). It opened on or before 18 May 1848 (a Thursday), date on  co n ,  Hull Packet 19 th :   ‘... a passenger station has been opened ... at Thornton Curtis, within a Quarter of a Mile of the OLD ABBEY, the magnificent Ruins and Pleasure Grounds of which the Rt, Hon. the Earl of Yarborough [company chairman] has been kindly pleased to throw open to the Public’; clearly aimed at tourists since later adverts emphasised availability to picnic parties. A monster Temperance Gala was held there on 14 August 1848; those arriving by rail ‘sped down a leafy lane’ to the abbey  (Sheffield Independent 19 th ) . It was still shown in tt headed alterations for 17 October in Hull paper (20 th ), which would suggest wider than tourist use but then disappeared from there also, no detailed tables appearing in Hull paper until 1851. The next mention found was for another Gala on 9 July 1849 when Hull paper (15 th ) described ‘Thornton’ station as a small roadside one (i.e. stopping trains only). Nowhere was there any mention of this as a special use or a new site, though journalists were more interested in the event itself. In any case it would have made no sense for a tourists’ station to be out of use for the time suggested by  Brad . Added strength is given to suspicion by  hb , which in 1862 just had T, in 1867 T ABBEY OR CURTIS; Macaulay’s maps showed T CURTIS 1851, T ABBEY 1854.   Still open.\n",

In 1877  hb  DRYPOOL is shown ‘P’ (Airey’s name for Victoria Dock; probably error). Temporary  non-tt  station for opening of HULL JOINT DOCK 26 June 1914 (ticket evidence, D Geldard). Excursion Platforms : Main one was regarded as extension of Paragon:  earliest reference seen  Hull Packet 21 January 1876  – ‘on the Anlaby Road’, one of a multitude of tradesmen’s notices using it as a reference point for their premises over many years; NE company’s notices treated it as part of Paragon, occasionally adding ‘entrance from Anlaby Road’ (separate site from entry of this name under ‘A’); no evidence seen for use during First World War; only uses seen in Second were for returning troops  (Hull Daily Mail 22 August 1944)  and for reception of Dutch refugee children  (ibid 12 March 1945) ; Rugby League supporters’ trains would run from platforms 12 and 13 ‘outside the station’  (ibid 1 November 1946) ; most recent seen  Hull Daily Mail 29 January   1949  for similar event but further evidence needed to determine last use. (H) NEWINGTON  [NE]: according to works in print this  op 8 October 1896; perhaps origin was that local timber merchant, Mr Jameson, built platform for invalid wife, using own materials; and was later used for fairs. Was this enlarged for later use or a separate site? ‘New excursion platform(s)’ erected for Yorkshire Show (19, 20, 21 July 1899); excursionists would step straight into showground; those from Paragon would walk to main entrance in Anlaby Road (where it was well west of Paragon) or use good service of electric trams  (York Herald 11 th ; Hull Daily Mail 18 th ) ; this was clearly Newington since there were later petitions that Paragon should be used instead of the Newington excursion platform and improvements to that station made it ‘practically certain’ that this would be so  (Hull Daily Mail 7 April 1904  and  6 July 1905) ; Show held 9, 10, 11 August 1905. Newington continued in use for Hull Fairs (claimed to be the largest in the country):  Yorkshire Gazette 3 November 1899  included co’s adverts for excursion to here at time Fair was held and notices or reports have been seen for most years thereafter – e.g.  Manchester Evening News 6 October 1903;   The Era 22 October 1910; Hull Daily Mail 9 October 1914.  Pleasure part of the Fair was suspended 1915 to 1918 inclusive. No mention of use of Newington for full Fair in 1919  (Hull, paper 11 October  made its enquiries about Fair traffic at Paragon station) or 1920 and 1921; same paper  14 October 1922  said Fair excursions to Paragon excursion platform. It was present in Junction Diagrams 1909 (not in 1907) as ‘NEWINGTON’, 51 chains north of Cottingham Branch Junction and 1 mile 7 chains from Cottingham Junction; still present 1928 (inertia?).

      "(non-tt): MS&L notice  (T 13 May 1852)  says new dock will be opened for steamers and ships [freight] on 27 May at noon. Clear PIER station would be available then – main line of railway extends to edge of low water landing-stage, ‘where a passenger station  is  [compiler’s underlining] built and to which passenger trains will run in connection with the boats’. Exact date of first use not known – said subsequent advertisements would give details, but none found. Certainly likely that was in use by mid-August since half-yearly report (and meeting)  (T 20, 26 August)  say steam packets running to Hamburgh [sic], Rotterdam and Antwerp. Only relevant reference in GC’s list op opening dates  (RAIL 1005/273) , which goes as far as 22 March 1915, is ‘Royal Dock, Grimsby 27 May 1852’; no reference in list of closures. No explicit timetable evidence for its use has been seen; however, various indirect references, from RCH sources and as increasing amounts of detail were included in  Brad , suggest use, perhaps not continuous, until First War. Clearing House evidence is contradictory. Pier only given separate listing in Hand-books 1872 and 1877 (first time facilities listed, now shown goods only);  thereafter presumably treated as part of Royal Docks which was always shown goods only. Junction Diagrams show it as passenger station 1870 to 1929 (inclusive), with no closure shown in Supplement dated November 1939. Initially it was shown as 57 chains beyond Dock passenger station but this was amended to 55 in 1877. [The  first  diagram, 1867, had lumped most of Grimsby together.] England & Wales maps show it as passenger station still in 1923. A possible explanation for discrepancy is that Pier station was not available as starting point or destination in itself, which would also explain lack of direct evidence in  Brad . Brad  evidence: By July 1867 a train was shown as far as Great Grimsby (= Town, Docks not included separately) on days and at times that matched steamer sailings. By August 1887 relevant train was continuing to Cleethorpes. After September 1898, before or with August 1908  Brad  GC’s advert for steamer services (see e.g. p 966-7-8  Brad April 1910)  refers to trains running to Grimsby Docks ‘alongside the steamer’, which cannot literally be Grimsby Docks station since that is outside the docks, and says return passengers from Antwerp and Hamburg were conveyed to Docks station by omnibus; tt in body of book shows that relevant train was allowed longer than others between Town and Docks, suggesting that carriages might have been detached at Town and taken onto the Pier station.   Still same August 1914 (see  BLN 21 December 2014 , where it is suggested, probably correctly, that service ceased with war – Clearing House information often out of date) . Included in table in  Bilbrough  1924, without any indication of facilities; omitted 1928. Non-tt : report of 7 December 1854 referred to (very incomplete) CLEETHORPE [ROAD? – there is a mention of junction at C R] as intermediate station; presumably nothing ever came of this.\n",

      "Midland Based on information provided by R Bond and J Gough. Op 12 June 1848  (Lancaster 17 th ) . Short section opened because Poulton was bathing-place for Lancaster people. The company’s ½   yearly said ‘A temporary station has been completed at Poulton’  (Lancaster 2 September)  – did this mean no station earlier? incomplete station earlier, now completed? An account of the line was written by T Edmondson in  The Poulton Railway Companion , Lancaster, 1848. This can be dated to a time after opening of the line but before opening of the North Western Hotel on 11 September 1848. This shows that station was then in Northumberland Street – station or stop there from outset? (No obvious alternative site). Edmondson also mentioned an intermediate station between Lancaster and Poulton-le-Sands, beneath an arch of the Lancaster & Carlisle [later part of LNW] bridge over the River Lune; no other information known – short-lived ‘halt’? For its earliest appearance in  Brad  the table is headed ‘Morecambe branch’ but POULTON appears in the table; renamed from POULTON-LE-SANDS to MORECAMBE (August 1850 tt). Main station  replaced by temporary station 4 November 1906, that by permanent  during the day of 24 March 1907, after departure of 9.50 a.m. to Lancaster. Clo  Tuesday  8 February 1994 (last train Monday)  (BLN 722-4/51 pp 26, 40, 57, 103) ;  new op 6 June 1994 about ¼ mile east, on site of station clo 1907  ( RM October) . Became M PROMENADE 2 June 1924  (Rly Gaz 23 May) , reverted  6 May 1968  (Mid) . Still open. The Wooden Pier  was brought into use for goods in 1850. The earliest reference to its use for passengers is for 12 July 1850 but that was only for landing people from a steamer and the earliest reference to trains in connection was in a notice for June 1851 and that did not specify that trains ran  onto  the pier (local press).  Brad  October 1853 has note about sailings to Belfast on Wednesdays and Saturdays and from there Mondays and Thursdays and says that steamer will not sail from Morecambe until after arrival of passenger  train; since only 5 minutes allowed for transfer, suggests trains ran onto wooden pier. This was renamed M HARBOUR by circular dated 15 December 1854. BoT letter dated 5 June 1855, about level crossings, says lines to timber jetty had been in use for some time, those to pier expected to be completed in a few months; only goods traffic mentioned as using these but does not specifically say ‘goods only’. First reference in  Brad  for replacement M PIER on stone jetty was August 1856. Thereafter appearance erratic. Initial explanation is that had begun service without BoT permission since it was only a short extension of existing line; service started only ‘a short time’ before 25 August 1856, date on letter to BoT asking for clarification. When told permission was necessary, service stopped. At first failed inspection. BoT finally sent permission to open on 30 October 1856. Soon removed from ordinary table in  Brad  but information in steamer sailings section implied continued use – one complication was that sailings were dependent on tide and times varied from day to day. Use ceased with effect from 1 September 1904, on opening of Heysham  (Cl) . LNW This company opened its line to Morecambe 8 August 1864, initially using Midland station.\n",

See article by Canon Fellows, RM 1944, pp 209 – 212, 272 – 274 : aim was to provide station nearer West End, to which omnibus connections would be provided; would also save SE and Croydon companies need to pay tolls they considered too high, for using the Greenwich’s line to London Bridge. Diversion of traffic caused the Greenwich to reduce tolls. Thus the Croydon stopped using after 31 March 1845. SE continued to use; services from London Bridge and here were joined at 'New Cross' (letter T 1 August 1845) – was this writer’s version of North Kent Junction, or point further out? At end of October 1846 ordinary SE passenger service withdrawn. They continued to attach passenger coach to 11 p.m. goods from B A for people catching morning steamers from Folkestone and Dover; this last in tt January 1851. Meanwhile, SE had tried to tap local traffic: from 1 September 1849 a shuttle service was run to North Kent Junction to connect with Greenwich and Kent trains (u se detailed in SE  co ½ T 20 September , which refers, not entirely accurately, to B A branch being ‘opened’ now to ‘the junction station with the North Kent line’). 21 August 1850 shunting engine hit a wagon into a pillar, bringing down roof  (T 22 nd ) . SE notice, T 22 nd  said from ‘this day’ they would cease to use B A, report in next day’s paper confirmed had done.  Probably end of North Kent Junction. Reappeared in 12 November 1850 tt in  South Eastern Gazette  – not present 5 November tt . Last in  Brad  1852; present in April tts  South Eastern Gazette –  no tts seen later that year. Special train carrying hearse containing the Duke of Wellington’s body from Walmer to Lying-in-State at Chelsea Hospital and a select group of mourners arrived here in the early hours of 11 November 1852  (London Evening Standard 11 th ) . Various press items show that clearly goods only by then. Special train for Princ e Consort left here 3 June 1855  (see EARLSWOOD). 1856: special first-class trains from here so people from West End could go to Sandhurst 3 May (to see Queen lay foundation stone of Wellington College) and 2 June for fete there  (co notices T 1, 28 May) . Early excursions.

According to D&C 6 formal opening was 22 August 1840 and it remained ‘little more than a colliery tramway’. The Returns always show it as not used for passemgers. In 1846 it became part of the Caledonian; part of its track was lifted as a result of an Act of 1867. If any passenger service was operated (some sort of workmen’s?), it would have been very short-lived; {on south bank of Clyde, between the General Terminus and line to Glasgow Central HL}.\n",
